@style Synthwave  

@lyrics :start  
Verse 1:  
The city hums a melody, electric and alive,  
Beneath the neon sky, we let the shadows thrive.  
Reflections in the glass, of moments we can't keep,  
The night holds all our secrets, buried deep.  

Chorus:  
Beneath the neon sky, we’re dancing in the glow,  
Lost in the rhythm, where only we can go.  
The colors fade and blur, but we’ll never say goodbye,  
We’re eternal, beneath the neon sky.  

Verse 2:  
The skyline whispers stories of hearts that never heal,  
Yet in your gaze, I find a world that feels surreal.  
The pulse of every streetlight matches with our hearts,  
Together in this dream, where endings never start.  

Chorus:  
Beneath the neon sky, we’re dancing in the glow,  
Lost in the rhythm, where only we can go.  
The colors fade and blur, but we’ll never say goodbye,  
We’re eternal, beneath the neon sky.  

Bridge:  
Time slows to a crawl, as midnight takes the stage,  
Our silhouettes entwined, breaking free of the cage.  
We’ll live in this illusion, where dreams refuse to die,  
Forever bound, beneath the neon sky.  

Outro:  
And as the dawn arrives, the city starts to weep,  
But we’ll stay in this moment, where memories never sleep.
